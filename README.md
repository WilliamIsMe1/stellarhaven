# Stellar Haven

## Description
A game in which you are the leader of a colony of settlers on a new planet. However, because of the energy needed to terraform the planet you need to colonize, you need to stay in the station while the planet below is transformed. You only brought enough food for the trip and a bit more, so you need to start growing right now. This is a multi-generational task, so your colony must manage both its current crew and a crew to come, for many years.

## Mechanics
You have a few things you can do. You can create buildings, change salaries for jobs, and also upgrade current buildings. Jobs are created as you create buildings, and some buildings can upgrade nearby buildings as part of their function. Each building takes up one tile.

NPCs are special in that they are able to move around between tiles and within tiles. They also have special behaviors and traits, along with goals such as where they want to walk, where they like to work, how they like to solve problems (just a left-hemisphere vs right-hemisphere value that determines their effectiveness at certain jobs, like art vs engineering vs computer maintenance), and so much more.
